Whales Hate Birds is a one to four-person game. It can be single-player on a keyboard with the arrow buttons or it can have up to four players by plugging in an Xbox dongle for PC. We recommend Xbox controllers for multi-player. 

Game Instructions: Use the left joystick to swim in the ocean (one person can use the arrow keys on the keyboard). The faster you are swimming when you leave the water, the higher you will jump! To win the game, EAT THE MOST BIRDS. Turn on your sound to hear the music. Play now at https://cdileo.github.io/GGJ2017/
